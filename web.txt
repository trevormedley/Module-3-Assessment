The internet is a massive network that connects devices from all over the world. Using the internet users can share information and communicate with one another wherever there is connection. When you are on your device and you click a link, you are requesting to get data from a server. Signals are sent through fiber optic cables to that specific server, and then the information you requested is sent back!
